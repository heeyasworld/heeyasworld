- 👋 Hi, I’m Jeonghee Kim from S.Korea but I go by "Summer" here.

- 👀 I’m interested in learning new human and computer languages,
     playing tennis, working out, walking outside :)

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ReactJS.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on making a new web and app service about Learning languages,
     cuz I speak Korean, Japanese, English and Spanish.
     So I'm really interested in making new educational programs to help people with language skills.

- 📫 How to reach me?
     Just follow my instagram "summerjeongheekim"
     or you can mail me "heeyaworld@icloud.com" here.
     
- 😘 Thank you for reading my profile, hope you have a gooooood one! :)
